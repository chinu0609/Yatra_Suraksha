This Project is the solution for Accident Data Analysis Problem Statement for Karnatkak State Police Hackathon.

We have created a mobile app which basically has three features

    1) Black Spot or Intensity of accident around current or given location in the radius of 5Km.

    2) Probability estimation based on various categorical features that user will provide and get a rough probability of accident occurence.

    3) We have done Accident Data Aanalysis and the conclusions that we have drawn are all mentioned in the report.
